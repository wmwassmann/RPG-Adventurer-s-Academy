            LANDING 

            1. Ahhh Greetings, and welcome to The RPG: Adventurer's Academy! Come in! Come in! 
            2. Allow my to introduce myself.  My name is Argus Timbers and I shall be your student councilor! Now, it is my duty to assess all prosepctive student 
            and guide them towards whatever adventurous calling ingites their heroic spark - The Academy's universal symbol of an adventurer.  
            3. From the instance you set foot within these halls, your actions have been monitored, and every future action will count towards igniting your heroic spark. 
            4. But of course there are many methods one may utilize in acquiring their heroic spark. For example, does your heart yearn for daring adventure, 
            the thrill of combat, and protecting those in need? Or are you more interested in the subtler aspects of the adventurer's path such as complex social interactions, 
            or perhaps a wide set of skills or character traits to accomplish your goals through less violent means?

            Player Selects 

            One assesses them as more interested in combat
            The other assesses them as more interested in role play
            Third option says, either!

            5. 
            
            
            Within these halls you will master the art of combat, study the nuances of role play scenarios, and learn a wide variety of spellcasting techniques. (Rewrite to ask questions) 
            3. But as one might expect, there are many different paths an adventurer might take. Here at the RPG: Adventurer's Academy, we hope to equip you with the proper 
                tools, knowledge, and skills you will need in order successfully navigate your very first adventure.
        
            4. Now, are you ready to take your first steps towards adventure?
